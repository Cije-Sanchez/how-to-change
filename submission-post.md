# How to Build Lasting Change

**"How to Build Lasting Change"** is an interactive Three.js visualizer inspired by the widely popular Kurzgesagt video, [_"Change Your Life – One Tiny Step at a Time"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75d_29QWELk) on YouTube. The video delves into the science behind habits, explaining how routines form and how small, consistent changes can lead to lasting personal growth. It offers practical tips for creating and sustaining new habits while addressing the challenges of change.

The visualizer complements the video’s audio by showcasing a mesmerizing morphing sphere that evolves in real-time as the narration progresses.

## **Why I Built It**

The purpose of this visualizer is to create a more immersive experience by combining visual and auditory stimuli. Visual elements add an additional layer of engagement, helping to maintain focus and reducing the chances of the mind wandering.

I aim to mirror Kurzgesagt’s mission of empowering individuals to understand and embrace the psychology of habit formation. This project aspires to motivate users to take small, actionable steps toward sustainable self-improvement while demystifying the process of change.

## **How I Used GitHub**

GitHub’s AI tools were instrumental in developing this project:

- **Autocomplete:** Assisted with Three.js syntax for creating and animating the sphere.
- **Copilot Chat:** Helped brainstorm creative approaches to morph the sphere in meaningful and visually appealing ways.
- **Inline Chat:** Generated much of the markup, styling, and Three.js code, streamlining the development process.
